Objectives:

● Extract feature data from a data set.

● Synchronize data from two sensors.

● Compute and report overall statistical measures from data.

Metrics extracted:
1. Percentage time in hyperglycemia (CGM > 180 mg/dL),
2. percentage of time in hyperglycemia critical (CGM > 250 mg/dL),
3. percentage time in range (CGM >= 70 mg/dL and CGM <= 180 mg/dL),
4. percentage time in range secondary (CGM >= 70 mg/dL and CGM <= 150 mg/dL),
5. percentage time in hypoglycemia level 1 (CGM < 70 mg/dL), and
6. percentage time in hypoglycemia level 2 (CGM < 54 mg/dL).
